# COSC-310 
For COSC 310,
This code is a conversation between a user and a chatbot to discuss phone problems. It is comprised of classes:

--> The first class is the Apple class, it is responsible for creating the list of keywords necessary for our program to return a corresponding response. It also creates the list of prepared responses.

--> The second class is the GUI class, it is responsible for developing the user interface for our chat bot. (all the visual stuff)

--> The 3rd class is the survey class, it is responsible for providing the closing survey for users to fill out. It will also save the results of the survey to a text file.

--> The 4th class is the main class and simply responsible for creating a new GUI object

--> The 5th class is called the solution class. It is responsible for searching the device class, with the user-entered keyword, and finding a solution.

--> The 6th class is called the Test class and is used for testing our code's functionality.

--> The 7th class is called the logger class and it is responsible for recording the entire conversation between the user and bot.

--> The 8th class is a new class called the Android Class which adds functionality for android users.

--> The 9th class is a new class called Spell check and it compares incorrectly spelt words with its database to see if it can detect underlying meaning

--> The 10th class is a new class called POS which takes apart the sentences inputted by the user and separates them into parts of speech.
